Hello,

This is a quick sorting algorithm speed tester between QuickSort and BucketSort.

You need to pass in a new .txt file that contains the integer array data you want to input in the followng format:
Line 1: Size of List
Line 2 to N+1: (i-1)-th element of the array. (so 2nd line would have the 0th index (aka 1st element) of the array, 3rd would have the 1st index, and so on..)


I have included a python file generator. Edit the ListSize variable to have a different array length and edit the SampleSize variable to have a different sample size.


Sample Command Line Usage:
gcc -o Sort SortTest.c
./Sort sample_file.txt



Thanks for using. Feel free to use this code. I have borrowed the sort algorithms from online.
